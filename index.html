            <h1 class="Name">AATROX</h1>

            <p class="bio">Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void,
                Aatrox and his brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra,
                and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery. But after centuries of imprisonment, Aatrox was the
                first to
                find freedom once more, corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical
                weapon
                that contained his essence. Now, with stolen flesh
                , he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form,
                seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance

        <h4>Passive</h4>
        <h3>Deathbringer Stance</h3>
        <p>Aatrox’s next basic attack has increased range and deals a percentage of the target’s maximum health as damage. 
            This attack also significantly reduces all healing and shielding on the target for a few seconds.

            Deathbringer Stance’s cooldown is slightly reduced whenever Aatrox casts a spell or when he lands the edge of The Darkin Blade on a champion.</p>
